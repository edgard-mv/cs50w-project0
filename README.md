Website center around video games.

There are three main files as of now:

### index.html

### latest_titles.html
Contains a unordered list with titles launched in the current month.

### best_selling.html
Contains a table listing the best selling titles of all time, just the top 5 as of now.

There is a lot to be implemented yet.
